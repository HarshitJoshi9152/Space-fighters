IDEAS
    make the space ship tilt while moving up or down

    how about i make it into a 3d voxel game ?
    should have a city in background (by which i mean chance to showcase beautiful pixel art) ...
    ... and skyscrapers should constantly come in the players may to restrict motion or act as destructible etc;


i figured that delay should nt be there in the bullet class
